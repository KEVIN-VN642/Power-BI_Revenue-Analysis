# Data Model for Company
In this project, we create a data model and Power BI report for Seven Sages Brewing Company that combines information from all over the company. The data model will make it possible for the company's CFO to quickly review and analyze what beers sell well and which ones generate the highest profitability.

At the end, we will have applied data technique for solving a very common issue facing many companies. More importantly, We will have a solid foundation to build on when it comes to more complex reporting visualization demands, advanced DAX requirements, or larger data models. No matter how large the data models get as our career progresses, the core principles remain the same.
